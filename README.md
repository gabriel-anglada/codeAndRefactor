# codeAndRefactor

This is the refactored code. The main idea behind this refactor is to separate and encapsulate the functionallity. A full set of models has been created to control de data integrity and to work easily with data objects.

The main bootstrap file is **main.ts** located in *refactored_code/* folder.

Some comments have been added through the documentation, if any questions or suggestions arise before the interview, you can contact me via email.
